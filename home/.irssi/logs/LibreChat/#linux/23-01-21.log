15:03   hexnewbie   Chiester: Indeed, upgrading through terminal does not require reboots on the same system. But the GNOME OSD keyboard lacks arrow keys, among others, making the terminal truly difficult to use there

15:08   hexnewbie   “The goal of Computer Science is to build something that will last at least until we've finished building it”
15:09      rascul   computer science is the worst

15:14   hexnewbie   perrierjouet: Restore file from backups?
15:14      rascul   hexnewbie ahh the c one doesn't have the bug i expected
15:14      rascul   good job
15:15   hexnewbie   rascul: Now I'm curious, which potential mistake did I miss?
15:15      rascul   >/dev/full and $? should not be zero

15:16   wowbagger > has joined.
15:17      rascul   a message on stderr would be nice but not necessarily required as long as main() returns non-zero
15:17   hexnewbie   perrierjouet: Yes, it tells you what to do. Rescrubbing with hopes it will repair the file on the second run (I'm surprised this happens when there's a mirror available, but a mirror is not backup) may help, according to web searches which I'm sure you ran

15:19   hexnewbie   rascul: Python always throws up errors if it can't write to stdout (or even stderr), yes. I consider it a nuisance rather than correct behaviour in many cases (it used to break services whose stdout disconnected, before systemd came along and redirected those to the journal).
15:19   hexnewbie   For Hello World, I'd assume it is the correct one, though
15:20      rascul   yep the python one whined very loudly
15:20      rascul   but it did return 0 exit code though
15:20       madam > has joined.
15:20  sammelweis > has joined.

15:31     Helenah   hexnewbie: If an exception is being thrown that you just want to pass on then you could always put "pass" into an "except" statement.
15:31       wmute > has joined.
15:32 frostschutz > has joined.
15:32   hexnewbie   Helenah: I need to wrap every print call in a particular exception block. Might as well switch to using the logging module, which is more work but already ignores exceptions
15:33       MrTek < has quit.
15:33     Helenah   hexnewbie: I wrote my own logging easily, why not have the print done within the logger functions?
15:33   hexnewbie   Or the the daemon with >/dev/null 2>/dev/null, or with systemd
15:33        kabe < has quit.
15:33  emmanuelux > has joined.
15:33     Helenah   That way you don't have to keep repeating "print" surrounding it by try and except, it's already done when the logger is called.
15:33   hexnewbie   Which would avoid crashes if some third-party module decides to print things
15:34      rascul   log all the things
15:34      Inline < has quit.
15:34      rascul   (at the proper log level)
15:34  iamkarlson < has quit.
15:34   hexnewbie   logging.log(-100, "Adding x and y"); z = x + y
15:35       MrTek > has joined.
15:35     Helenah   hexnewbie: Is that how you're passing log entries? Into that function? So wouldn't your print be inside it which you'd only need one?
15:35         bmr < has quit.
15:35      rascul   that might be debug level
15:35   hexnewbie   I think DEBUG is 10, but I forget
15:35      rascul   different implementations do levels slightly different
15:35      rascul   it seems
15:35     Helenah   Oh, ah! Now I see!
15:36      rascul   oh DEBUG is on line 10? 'GOTO 10' should do it
15:36     Helenah   rascul: They do, for example mine you just do something like pass "INFO" or "DEBUG" or whatever to the logger.
15:36     Helenah   and and the logger would report back if the level is invalid.
15:37      rascul   in rust i typically have fancy macros i can use like info!("i like pie")
15:37      rascul   it is very important to make an informative note in the log about whether you like pie or not
15:37    wingsorc < has quit.
15:38     Helenah   I found it soo easy to code loggers that it confused me why there are libraries that do this very thing. I suppose I'm that sort of person who wants to ensure they get only the banana if that's all they want but not the full package (monkey, banana, sunset and jungle). Like I don't like big frameworks for example because I think they're adding more to a project than one may require from one or a few
15:38     Helenah   of its modules.
