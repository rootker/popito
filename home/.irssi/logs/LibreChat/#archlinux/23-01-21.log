14:33   tsokkur71   i have this problem 
14:33   tsokkur71   vim: /usr/lib/libtiff.so.5: no version information available (required by /usr/lib/libgdk_pixbuf-2.0.so.0)

14:35   Namarrgon   update your system, rebuild any unofficial packages

14:35   tsokkur71   ok thanks
14:36   fedorafan > has joined.
14:37  gnaggnoyil   Which version of gcc is the current `linux-rt-lts` package built from? Is this compatible with current gcc version?
14:37 loathingker < has quit.
14:38  gnaggnoyil   `dkms` reports "incompatible gcc/plugin versions" when building kernel modules for `linux-rt-lts` kernel. E.g. when installing `nvidia-dkms`
14:38 operadicman < has quit.
14:38       chown < has quit.
14:38   Namarrgon   it should also tell you which versions were used for both in the build log
14:39    fancieux > has joined.
14:39      LemanR > has joined.
14:39   Namarrgon   but if it complains you already know it wasn't the same version you have installed
14:38   tsokkur71   Namarrgon: is there a way to see size of all package installed it once ?
14:39     flower_ > has joined.
14:38   tsokkur71   not separated just size of all package installed in system
14:39    flower__ > has joined.
14:40   Namarrgon   tsokkur71: nothing built into pacman, you can get the individual sizes from e.g. 'expac' and then sum them up
14:40   Namarrgon   the wiki might have a oneliner
14:40  gr33n7007h > has joined.
14:39   tsokkur71   Namarrgon: but there no way to see all size in once not seprated package by package ?

14:40   tsokkur71   Namarrgon: you should guys build that feature into pacman or in expac that show size of all package it once

14:44      LemanR   Couldn't you get a list of all packages, dependencies then do something like df on those locations (can be found with whereis) and get some sort of summation. Just brain storming. But I don't think it's really needed in pacman though
14:44   Namarrgon   tsokkur71: i don't care about a feature like that either way but what would it be useful for?
14:44      vardo_ > has joined.
14:44  gnaggnoyil   Namarrgon: Oops just noticed that. With `nvidia-dkms` I saw the the following warning at the start of the log: warning:
14:44  gnaggnoyil   warning: the compiler differs from the one used to build the kernel 
14:44  gnaggnoyil     The kernel was built by: gcc (GCC) 12.2.0 
14:44  gnaggnoyil     You are using:           cc (GCC) 12.2.1 20230111
14:44   flower___ > has joined.
14:44      LemanR   related question, what is the use case here? I'm curious why this is wanted.
14:45      jinsun > has joined.
14:45         kts < has quit.
14:45   Namarrgon   gnaggnoyil: was the warning fatal or did dkms build the modules anyway?
14:44   tsokkur71   Namarrgon: to knwo how much all package used of space so we can manage that storage if i do du -hs /home/ to see all stroge in home but how about packages i should go one by one or i reinstall system to be clean again it will be really usefull we have that feature

14:49        Tom^ < has quit.
14:49  gnaggnoyil   Namarrgon: The warning itself isn't marked as fatal but the following build events did exit with an error, with many error messages being "cc1: error: incompatible gcc/plugin versions"
14:49        Tom^ > has joined.
14:49   Namarrgon   then the kernel needs a rebuild
14:49      LemanR   tsokkur71 but what's with the fixation of having it built in? why is having a separate package for this function a bad thing? You'd think if I can have Function X being equally effective if it's modular or baked into the package manager then it's better for it to be modular.
14:52  gnaggnoyil   Namarrgon: So should we submit a bug report and request a rebuild?
14:54        hugo < has quit.
14:53   tsokkur71   LemanR: filelight it really usefull do you any other usefull tools for notetaking or todo or any usefull ?
14:54 terminalpus > has joined.
14:55      LemanR   for this we should probably move out of arch main chat. I have to find the name for the random chat. But as a Master's student I have (what I feel to be) a great workflow.

14:57      LemanR   tsokkur71 for chatting about also tools we can move to archlinux-offtopic as it's not really archlinux focused (more like linux focused)
